#### Force
If you know how hard you hit something (the force, F) you can predict how predict
how fast and in what direction that something will begin to move(its acceleration).
```
F = ma
m = mass
a = accelleration
```
Remember that mass is measure of the amount of matter in a body. Weight is the
force by which a body is attracted to Earth.

Potential energy can be though of as stored energy that has potential to cause
motion. This varies in different positions. Take the gravitational force which
gets weaker as two masses move away from each other.


#### Max Planck
1901 Radiation is emmitted in descrete packages of energy (quanta).
A quantum is the smallest unit of energy (like there cannot be 1/2 quantam).
```
h = 6.626x10^-34 Joule*sec
```
So this is the smallest amount that a light can disposite enery in. Nothing smaller
than this.

### Joule
Is the energy exerted when a force of 1 Newton is applied over 1 meter of distance.
So above we said that marabou bar weighing 100 grams will have a force of 1 Newton.
So if we lift the marabou bar 1 meter into the air, that would take one Joule of
energy to lift.

#### Waves/frequency
Energy/frequency of photons
```
<--------- Less Energy ----- More Energy ------------------------------------>

Radio   Micro   IR    Visible                             UV    X-ray   Gamma
                     red/orange/yello/green/blue/violet

<--------- Lower frequency - Higher frequency ------------------------------->
```
Gamma photons are the most energetic and have the highest frequence meaning that
they have the hightest frequency waves.

Lets take violet light and show what the energy is for a photon of this type:
````
f = 7.5*10^14Hz
```
So we take that and use plank constant to calculate the energy:
```
E = (6.626x10^-34)(2.998x10^8)
```

Photons have no mass which means they travel at the speed of light (only at the
speed of light). This is true for anything that has mass=0.
White light can be produced by combining red/green/blue together.

The amount of energy in one photon:
```
E = hf                h = 6.626x10^-34 Joule/sec, f=frequency, the number of oscilaations per second (Hz)
c = fλ                λ = the wavelength in meters
f = c/λ
E = h * c/λ
```

Momentum is a `measurement of mass in motion`, so it is how much mass is in how
much motion. The symbol `p` is used for momentum.
```
p = m * v                 m=mass, v=velocity
```

When something is traveling near the speed of light then the classical forumla
for momentum does not hold true, instead the momentum of a photon is:
```
E² = m₀²c⁴ + p²c²    m₀=is the rest mass, p=the momentum of the particle squared

Light has no rest mass so the first term of the above addition becomes 0:
E² = m₀²c⁴ + p²c²    
E² = 0 + p²c²    
E² = p²c²    
√E² = √p²√c²
E = pc

E = hf

h²f² = p²c²
√h²√f² = √p²√c²
hf = pc
c/f = h/p
The speed of light/frequency is lamda (wavelenght);
λ = h/p

λ = h/p
p = h/λ
```


Wavelength is the distance between two top/bottom oscillations.
Amplitude is the distance from 0 of the oscillation. The wave rises equally
above and below zero.

Photons do not oscillate in position or time; rather the oscillations come from 
the corresponding electromagnetic field. That electromagnetic field, in turn, 
can be measured directly by its effect on charged particles.

Einstein’s theory of relativity showed us that mass is a form of energy. So in 
analogy with light, massive particles (like electrons) can be considered to be 
chunks of energy associated with matter waves. The particles themselves are 
not waves. They don’t oscillate up and down as they travel.

With all about a photon being considered a wave and a particle we have to separate
this when thinking about the photon. When considering the photon as a particle
imaging it traveling in a straight path until it bounces off something or gets
absorbed. And something would be an atom I think. The waves are periodic changes
in the strenght of the electromagnetic field. So there is no actual motion in the
perpendicular direction in the direction that the wave is traveling.

Recall the two slit experiment, if we take the view point of photons as waves
the brightest parts of the pattern that appear is where the amplitude of the 
resulting wave was greatest (the locations of constructive interference).
If we take the particle view the bright line corresponds to areas where the photons
are most likely to land during any period of time.

And remember that we can't predict exactly where any individual photon or electron
will land after traversing the doulbe slits but we can see the pattern we can say
that the probability is higher for certain positions.
The probability is high where the amplitude is high due to constructive interference.
Remember that amplitude is the distance from 0 of the oscillation. The wave rises equally
above and below zero. So from zero to where the wave turns direction up or 
down.

The square of a particle’s wave function at a point in space and time is equal to the probability of finding the particle at that point in space and time—is attributed to the German physicist Max Born. 

#### Energy
```
Energy = Planks constant * wave frequency
E = hf
```
#### Photon
So a photon is something that has energy but no mass. There is a limit to the
amount of energy that a photon can disposit, and it cannot disposit any less
that a certain amount (quantum).
Photons are associated with electromagnetic waves and it is these electromagnetic
waves that oscialate and not the photon itself.

Light and all electromagnetic radiation displays both wave-like and particle-like
behaviour.

When something gets heated the electrons start to ossilate with higher and higher
frequencies.

#### Atom
The atom is a structure with a nucleus which is the center of the atom and it contains
protons (positive) and neutrons (negative). The outer regions of the atom hold electrons which orbit the
nucleus.

Protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass, about 1.67 × 10^-24 grams.
Electrons are much smaller in mass than protons, weighing only 9.11 × 10^-28 grams, 
or about 1/1800 of an atomic mass unit. 
99% or more of the atom is empty space!

A electron can move along the states/rings around the atom but absorbing the 
energy from an photon in which case it moves to an outer more ring, or it can emit
energy in form of a proton (perhaps more I'm not sure) to move inwards.

The number of protons and neutrons comprising an atoms nuclues determines that
atom's mass number (nucleon number).

#### Newton (N)
```
N = Kg * m * S^-2
m = meter
S = second
```
```
        |
        |  Weight force = 1 N
        |
       \ /
  +-----------+
  |           |
  | 100 grams |
  |           |
  +-----------+
```
So think of something that is 100 grams, for example a Marabou bar to
get a sence of how much 1 N is. This is the force that the bar pushes down on the
surface it is on.

#### Schrödinger's Equation
Is a tool to understand how a particles wave function changes at different points
in space and how it evolves over time. One would solve the equation for a specific
particle interacting with a physical system and the result is a wave function for
that particle.
```
 (kenetic energy) + (potential energy)    = (total enery)

   h²  ∂²Ψ(x,t)                             ih  ∂Ψ(x,t)
- ---- --------    + U(x)Ψ(x,t)           = --- -------
  8mπ²  ∂x²                                  2π  ∂t

h = Planck's constant
m = mass (never changes in the equation)
i = imaginary number
Ψ = is function of location x and time t.
U = potential energy of the particle
```
Total energy term is how fast the wave function is changing in time.

### Free particle
Is a particle moving through a region of space where no external forces act upon
it.
The wave function for a free particle is called a plane wave. This is formed
by two sine functions (one real and one imaginary).

#### Wave packet
This describes a wave that is localized to place in time and space. So it would
zero amplitude everywhere except around a specific location.

### Position and momentum
Why are there uncertainties in measuring a particles position and momentum. Recall
that momentum is the measurement of motion of a moving body and is the product
of mass and velocity.

Say we want to measure the position of a particle moving in direction x.
```
-----------------------------------> x
  particle moving in direction x
```
We want to measure x with the smallest possible uncertaity, call it delta x. So
we will have 
```
x+∆x
```
And we want to make ∆x as small as possible which will give the most accurate 
possition of the particle we are measuring. So to locate the object we have to
look at it which we do by shining light on it so that light bounces off it.
But the light used to find the particle is under the constraint of the lights
wavelenght, like we can't detect something smaller than the wavelength of the light
itself. So the following must hold true
```
λ < ∆x
```
Also when our particle gets hit by a photon it will be nudged a little in some
undetermined direction. How much it will get nedged?  Recall that the wavelenght
of a particle is equal to Plank's constant divided by momentum which is true for
both the particle and the photon hitting it. Momentum is equal to Planck's constant
divied by the wavelength. So the nudging of the particle will affect its momentum
Δp, so we could state this as:
```
λ = (h / Δp)
```
We can combine both of these into:
```
(h / Δp) < Δx
h < (Δp x Δx)
```
So the product of the two uncertainties must be larger than Planck's constant.
This Heisenbergs uncertainty principal.
We can measure the position of our particle to extremely small Δx. But as we do
that we will make it impossible to measure momentum very accurately. As shown above
the larger one is the lower the other was to be with an absolute minium being 
Planck's constant. So it is impossible to make the product smaller than Planck's constant
which means making one of the uncertainties really small will cause the other
to be larger.

### Conjugate Pairs
Are a pair of observables that obey the Heisenberg uncertainly principal.
Time and energy also have the same uncertainly behavious as we've seen with
position and momentum.

### Hadron
Is a composite particle made up of two or more quarks. There are two families
or hadrons, baryons and mesons.
```
1) Baryons have an odd number of quarks (usually 3).
Examples: Protons, Neutons
2) Mesons have an even number of quarks (usually one quark and an anti-quark).
Examples: Pions
```

### Quarks
Atoms are constructed of two types of elementary particles: electrons and quarks.
Quarks are what the proton and neutron are made of. Each proton and neutron are
made up of three quarks of two types, up quarks and down quarks.
```
Up quark charge:   +2/3
Down quark charge: -1/3
```
Protons:
```
+2/3 + 2/3 - 1/3 = 1 (electrical charge)
```
Neutrons:
```
+2/3 - 1/3 - 1/3 = 0 (electrical charge)
```
The necleus is held together by the "stong nuclear force".

A quark is a fast moving point of energy

### Four Fundamental forces
```
Gravity
All particles with mass are influenced by this force

Electromagnetic force
Acts on any particle with an electric charge.

Weak nuclear force
Operate on the ranges found inside the atomic nucleus.

Strong nuclear force
Operate on the ranges found inside the atomic nucleus.

```

### Standard Model
Particles are divided into fermions and bosons. Fermions are the building block
of matter, and bosons are force carrying particles
Fermions are further divided into two families of elementary particles named
quarks and leptons. Quarks are grouped/combine in two and threes to make up 
composite particles called Hadrons.
Subatomic particles with 3 quarks are called baryons. Those made of quark/anti-quark
pairs are called mesons.
There are 6 quark flavours:
```
up
down
strange
charm
top
bottom
```
Quarks have something, a quality, that is called colour charge. This allows them
to interact via the strong force.
