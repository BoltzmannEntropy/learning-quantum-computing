#### Max Planck
1901 Radiation is emmitted in descrete packages of energy (quanta).
A quantum is the smallest unit of energy (like there cannot be 1/2 quantam).
```
h = 6.626x10^-34 Joule*sec
```
So this is the smallest amount that a light can disposite enery in. Nothing smaller
than this.

### Joule
Is the energy exerted when a force of 1 Newton is applied over 1 meter of distance.
So above we said that marabou bar weighing 100 grams will have a force of 1 Newton.
So if we lift the marabou bar 1 meter into the air, that would take one Joule of
energy to lift.

#### Waves/frequency
Energy/frequency of photons
```
<--------- Less Energy ----- More Energy ------------------------------------>

Radio   Micro   IR    Visible                             UV    X-ray   Gamma
                     red/orange/yello/green/blue/violet

<--------- Lower frequency - Higher frequency ------------------------------->
```
Gamma photons are the most energetic and have the highest frequence meaning that
they have the hightest frequency waves.

Lets take violet light and show what the energy is for a photon of this type:
````
f = 7.5*10^14Hz
```
So we take that and use plank constant to calculate the energy:
```
E = (6.626x10^-34)(2.998x10^8)
```


Photons have no mass which means they travel at the speed of light (only at the
speed of light). This is true for anything that has mass=0.
White light can be produced by combining red/green/blue together.

The amount of energy in one photon:
```
E = hf                h = 6.626x10^-34 Joule/sec f=frequency, the number of oscilaations per second (Hz)
c = fλ                λ = the wavelength in meters
f = c/λ
E = h * c/λ
```

When something is traveling near the speed of light then the classical forumla
for momentum does not hold true, instead the momentum of a photon is:
```
E² = m₀²c⁴ + p²c²    m₀=is the rest mass, p=the momentum of the partical squared
light has no rest mass
E² = m₀²c⁴ + p²c²    
E² = 0 + p²c²    

E = hf

h²f² = p²c²
√h²√f² = √p²√c²
hf = pc
c/f = h/p
The speed of light/frequency is lamda (wavelenght);
λ = h/p

λ = h/p
p = h/λ
```

Wavelength is the distance between two top/bottom oscillations.
Amplitude is the distance from 0 of the oscillation. The wave rises equally
above and below zero.

Photons do not oscillate in position or time; rather the oscillations come from 
the corresponding electromagnetic field. That electromagnetic field, in turn, 
can be measured directly by its effect on charged particles.


#### Energy
```
Energy = Planks constant * wave frequency
     E = hf
```
#### Photon
So a photon is something that has energy but no mass. There is a limit to the
amount of energy that a photon can disposit, and it cannot disposit any less
that a certain amount (quantum).

Light and all electromagnetic radiation displays both wave-like and particle-like
behaviour.

When something gets heated the electrons start to ossilate with higher and higher
frequencies.

#### Atom
The atom is a structure with a nucleus which is the center of the atom and it contains
protons (positive) and neutrons (negative). The outer regions of the atom hold electrons which orbit the
nucleus.
Protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass, about 1.67 × 10^-24 grams.
Electrons are much smaller in mass than protons, weighing only 9.11 × 10^-28 grams, 
or about 1/1800 of an atomic mass unit. 
99% or more of the atom is empty space!

A electron can move along the states/rings around the atom but absorbing the 
energy from an photon in which case it moves to an outer more ring, or it can emit
energy in form of a proton (perhaps more I'm not sure) to move inwards.

#### Newton (N)
```
N = Kg * m * S^-2
m = meter
S = second
```
```
        |
        |  Weight force = 1 N
        |
       \ /
  +-----------+
  |           |
  | 100 grams |
  |           |
  +-----------+
```
So think of something that is 100 grams, for example a Marabou bar to
get a sence of how much 1 N is. This is the force that the bar pushes down on the
surface it is on.

#### Schrödinger's Equation
```
-h ∂²Ψ           ∂ψ
-- --- + Vψ = ih --
2m ∂x²           ∂t

```
