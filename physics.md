#### Max Planck
1901 Radiation is emmitted in descrete packages of energy (quanta).
A quantum is the smalles unit of energy (like there cannot be 1/2 quantam).


#### Waves/frequency
Energy/frequency of photons
```
<--------- Less Energy ----- More Energy ------------------------------------>

Radio   Micro   IR    Visible                             UV    X-ray   Gamma
                     red/orange/yello/green/blue/violet

<--------- Lower frequency - Higher frequency ------------------------------->
```
Gamma photons are the most energetic and have the highest frequence meaning that
they have the hightest frequency waves.
Photons have no mass which means they travel at the speed of light (only at the
speed of light). This is true for anything that has mass=0.
White light can be produced by combining red/green/blue together.

```
E = hf                h = 6.626x10^-34 Joule/sec
c = f位                位 = the wavelength
f = c/位
E = h * c/位

#### Energy
```
Energy = Planks constant * wave frequency
     E = hf
```
#### Photon

#### Newton (N)
```
N = Kg * m * S^-2
m = meter
S = second
```
```

So think of something that is 100 grams, for example a Marabou bar to
get a sence of how much 1 N is. This is the force that the bar pushes down on the
surface it is on.

### Joule
Is the energy exerted when a force of 1 Newton is applied over 1 meter of distance.
So above we said that marabou bar weighing 100 grams will have a force of 1 Newton.
So if we lift the marabou bar 1 meter into the air, that would take one Joule of
energy to lift.
